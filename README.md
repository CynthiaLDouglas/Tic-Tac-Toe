# Tic-Tac-TBC: A Description

In it's current state, this is simple work in progress striving to entertain you with a game that is easily learned but carefully mastered. The classic Tic-Tac-Toe game is played with two players named "X" and "O". Both of our players want to be winners but this can never be acheived. In this version of the game you will be both "X" and "O". "X" always begins and "O" plays immediately after. Alternately, you will place "X" and "O" in the squares until three in a row is acheived. Once complete, a winner, or not, will be announced. Remember, this is game that is carefully mastered.

## Planning Story

In the beginning, Tic Tac Toe was simply a game. Something that was drawn onto a sheet of paper and carefully pondered over until a winner prevailed, or not. I took the experience of playing this and dreamed up the dozens of themes I could create to style this on an app. After the dreams, I carefully used an app to map out my aspirations for the design. I drew boxes and modals. I labeled all the buttons. Next, I entered the coding phase. I began with curl scripts and ensured the processes worked within the terminal. This was very satisfying to see the requests work because then I knew they work on my SPA. I then began to write my html code for the basic forms, divs and buttons needed to outline the login, sign up and sign out and password events. I moved into the world of javascript where I found myself sinking into the abyss of functions and loops. I called for help and it came and went and I would find myself sinking and gasping and sometimes staying afloat long enough to make it into the ui where I would construct the messages that I would send to let the user know I was still there. In the end, I will celebrate but for now I will just keep swimming. 

### User Stories

- As a user, I must be able to sign up.
- As a user I must be able to sign in.
- As a user, I must be able to change my password.
- As a user, I must I must be able to sign out.
- As a user, I must be able to start a tic tac toe game.
- When playing game, the user must start as X and then rotate between X and O.
- When playing game, the user must only select available spaces on the board.
- When playing game, the user must be notified when win, loss or tie occurs.
- Once a game is over, the user must not be able to add to that board.
- Once a game is over, the user must be able to play again.
- Once signed in, the user must be able to view number of games played.

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### Unsolved Problems

**I Still need to:**
  - Allow a signed up user to start a new tic tac toe game.
  - Have each game begin with the user as X exclusively.
  - Notify the user of a win, loss, or tie.
  - Once a game is completed, allow the user to begin a new game.
  - Allow the user to sign and view the number of games played.

**I Would like to eventually:**
  - Allow the user to modify the look of the game.
  - Allow the user to view how many times 'X' and 'O' has won, lost, or tied.
  - Allow the user to know when they last logged in.
